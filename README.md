# DC-FIPD Method Code Repository
This repository contains the implementation of the DC-FIPD method for identifying fraudulent IPs. The repository structure is as follows:

## D Folder: 
This folder contains the source code for the DC-FIPD method. It includes the necessary scripts and modules to perform IP identification and risk assessment.
## train.csv File: 
The train.csv file represents the training data used for the DC-FIPD method. It contains a dataset of labeled IP addresses, which serves as the input for training the model and determining the IP risk levels.
## test.csv File: 
The test.csv file represents the testing data used to evaluate the performance of the DC-FIPD method. It contains a separate dataset of IP addresses that were not used during training. The DC-FIPD method will predict the risk levels for these IPs based on the trained model.
## Usage
To use the DC-FIPD method, follow these steps:  

Clone the repository to your local machine.  
复制  
git clone https://github.com/chenang520/DC-FIPD.git  
Navigate to the D folder and review the provided code files.  
Prepare your training data by placing it in the appropriate format and saving it as train.csv.  
Execute the training code using the train.csv file to train the DC-FIPD model.
